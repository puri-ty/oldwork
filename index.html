    <p class="text"><strong>A Book of Shadows</strong> is a book containing religious text and instructions for magical
        rituals found
        within the
        Neopagan religion of Wicca, and in many pagan practices. One famous Book of Shadows was created by the
        pioneering Wiccan Gerald Gardner sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilised first in his
        Bricket Wood coven and then in other covens which he founded in following decades. The Book of Shadows is also
        used by other Wiccan traditions, such as <i>Alexandrianism</i> and <i>Mohsianism</i>, and with the rise of books
        teaching
        people how to begin following Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further
        propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier traditions..

    <p class="text">The <b>ouroboros</b> or <b>uroboros</b> is an ancient
        symbol depicting a serpent or dragon[4] eating its own tail. Originating in ancient Egyptian iconography, the
        ouroboros entered western tradition via Greek magical tradition and was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and
        Hermeticism and most notably in alchemy. The term derives from Ancient Greek oura 'tail'
        plus -boros '-eating' The ouroboros is often interpreted as a symbol for eternal cyclic renewal or
        a cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The skin-sloughing process of snakes symbolizes the transmigration of
        souls, the snake biting its own tail is a fertility symbol. The tail of the snake is a phallic symbol, the mouth
        is a yonic or womb-like symbol.

<p class="text">Pentagrams were used symbolically in ancient Greece and Babylonia, and are used today as a symbol of
    faith by many <b>Wiccans</b>, akin to the use of the cross by Christians. The pentagram has magical associations.
    Many
    people who practice Neopagan faiths wear jewelry incorporating the symbol. Christians once commonly used the
    pentagram to represent the five wounds of Jesus.The pentagram is also used as a symbol by other belief
    systems and is associated with Freemasonry.</p>
